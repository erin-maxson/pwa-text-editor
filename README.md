## Installation

There's no need to install this project beyond hitting the "Install" button in the top left corner of the application.

## Usage

To use this application, you can load the heroku link [https://text-editor-enm.herokuapp.com/] or run npm start after installing node.js (npm i). Once open, you can remove all text and add your own text into the application. 

Upon exit and return, you'll find the last thing you added to the text editor in the application.
